Welcome to my corner of the internet where I share my thoughts, experiences, and passions. I'm Vishwamitra Hegde, though you might hear others refer to me as Vishwa or Vish for short.

By profession, I'm a Software Engineer with over a decade of experience developing scalable software solutions across various domains and industries. Beyond the confines of code, I'm an avid explorer, whether it's delving into the latest technologies or venturing into the great outdoors. I find joy in experimenting, whether it's in the realm of software or the kitchen, always seeking new adventures and experiences to share with you.

I began this blog with a simple purpose: to document my learning journey. As humans, we often forget things that we don't regularly use, and I'm no exception. However, I've come to see this as a blessing in disguise. This blog serves as my digital repository, a place where I can document my experiments and findings, and refer back to them whenever needed. And who knows, perhaps you'll find some benefit from my experiences if you're on a similar quest for knowledge.

Thank you for taking the time to visit, and I hope you find exploring the contents of my blog as enjoyable as I find creating them!
